{{<section title="EJS">}}
EJS is a javascript template, which essentially allows us to implement Javascript into HTML files. Thanks to that we were able to display dynamic content on the pages.

{{<section title="MongoDB">}}
MongoDB is easy to implement with JS, which made it very attractive to us. Its objects  can easily be translated to JSON files as well.

{{<section title="Heroku">}}
We used it because it's a good platform for fast and easy deployment of web apps.

{{<section title="Node.js">}}
Npm makes it easy to implement external packages to our project. Node.js was our choice for the backend because it allows us to use JS both for the front and the backend.

{{<section title="Communication">}}
We used Trello for sprint planning, Zoom and Google meet for the meetings, Github to collaborate on code and the miro board for brainstorming and the visualization of ideas.
