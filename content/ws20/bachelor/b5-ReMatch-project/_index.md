ReMatch is a web application that **matches employees and recruiters** by use of the **Elasticsearch** data analytics engine which determines a compatibility score based on their individual profiles. The users are able to **view matches** that have the highest compatibility to their own criteria, **see the detailed information** of their matches and **express interest** if they choose to. 
Head over [here](https://rematch-htw.herokuapp.com) to explore our application.

{{<section title="Our Goals">}}
The recruiting process can be too centered around hard skills and tech stack, while **soft skills**, common values and cultural compatibility are the true factors, which determine how well a team is going to work together. We in **ReMatch** want to change this. ReMatch also aims to **fight bias** by bringing a diverse pool of talents and delegating the initial screening process from humans to software. It creates **equal opportunity** for job-seekers to be seen purely based on their skills and personality. Finding fitting candidates also **saves the companies time and money**, since employees wonâ€™t resign after a couple months due to poor cultural fits.

Great vision without great people is irrelevant.

<!-- TODO -->
How did you **split the work load**? Who was responsible for the front end? What obstacles did you overcome regarding team work?
Some teams of previous terms shared pictures of themselves, some did not.
It's up to you. Also keep in mind that **you don't have to follow the structure of this template**.
It is just a suggestion. If you upload **pictures of the team members** make sure they **are square!**
