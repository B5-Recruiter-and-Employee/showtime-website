**Research on Information Retrieval System**. We did research on ElasticSearch, Training ML models, Information retrieval systems and compared Elastic Search with Machine learning tools to decide on which tool will help us best for our match-making algorithm.  
**Benchmarking & Market research**. We thoroughly compared the existing hiring platforms on the market and found out the common issues that users faced while using these platforms.   
**User research**. Too long.. huhu someone write this pls...
**Web Scraping of Data with help of Python**. In the early stage of our development, we didnâ€™t have users yet, therefore we practiced web scraping from the Stackoverflow Jobs & Career page to have sample data for job offers and these data are used later on for testing.  
**Cleaning the data & keywords extraction**. We used rake-nltk Algorithm for keywords extraction to retrieve the first phrases for our sample data.

**Setting up the website backend** with Node.js, Express & MongoDB and establishing the connection between **database & ElasticSearch**  
**Implementing key features:**  
<li>Matches for recruiter & job seekers</li>  
<li>Free search for job seekers with filters</li>  
<li>Email notification</li>  
<li>Calculation of confidence score for matches</li>

**Enhancing our frontend** by using Bootstrap and custom styling and also **restructuring and refactoring the backend** to have a good structure and clean code.    
**Deploying our web application**. We did research on cloud platforms to decide on which one we use to deploy our first release. After all we trusted Heroku - a very elegant, flexible, and easy to manage service- to be our platform. The most important thing is Heroku also supports ElasticSearch add-ons, the heart of our application.
